    // By default because the LeaderboardFragment and the RegisterFragment are not top level fragments, they will default to showing an up button or left arrow on the toolbar plus the title of the fragment
    // If you don't want the up button, it can be removed in MainActivity's OnDestinationChange - see example there.
    // This also means that the additional code in OnSupportNavigationUp can be removed. The code in OnSupportNavigationUp is there for when you do want for whatever reason want to retain the Up buttom.
    // All it does is to ensure that a fragment containing an Up button can still be directed away from the standard action of an up button, which is to always return when closing to the StartDestination Fragment.
